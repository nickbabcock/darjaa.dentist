## Dr. Ardyn Darjaa DMD

I'm an alum of the University of Illinois at Chicago's Dental Program. 

Currently I'm providing dental care at [Deer Creek Dental](https://www.deercreekdental.com/); performing services for O'Fallon, MO and surrounding areas. Alongside our quality care, I ensure meticulous notes are collected for each patient because I believe that superb care starts with communication and that means each visit we're able to resume as if you've never left.

Before Deer Creek, I served as a dentist in several communities surrounding the Chicago area. At Asian Human Services, we provided care for Chicago's immigrants, refugees, and the underserved. And in Beloit WI, I worked at the Beloit Area Community Health Center where people came for procedures only performed in the area.

By the way, I love seeing pictures of corgis! üê∂
