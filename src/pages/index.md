## Dr. Ardyn Darjaa DMD

I'm an alum of the University of Illinois at Chicago's Dental Program. 

Currently I'm providing dental care at [Deer Creek Dental](https://www.deercreekdental.com/); performing services for O'Fallon, MO and surrounding areas. Alongside our quality care, I ensure meticulous notes are collected for each patient because I believe that superb care starts with communication and that means each visit we're able to resume as if you've never left.

By the way, I love seeing pictures of corgis! üê∂
